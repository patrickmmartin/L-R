Here's an outline for a 20-minute technical presentation on the evolution of programming pipelines and early invariant definition:

Title: "From Makefiles to AI: The Evolution of Build-Time Constraints and Invariants"

I. Introduction (2 minutes)
- Brief history of build pipelines and compilation
- The fundamental problem: ensuring correctness before runtime
- Why early constraint definition matters

II. Historical Perspective (5 minutes)
- Early days: Basic compilation and linking
  - Make and shell scripts: primitive but flexible
  - Limited type checking, mostly syntax validation
- Rise of integrated development environments
  - Introduction of real-time syntax checking
  - Early static analysis tools
  - The emergence of lint-like tools

III. Modern Build Pipeline Evolution (5 minutes)
- Type Systems as Early Constraints
  - From C to Rust: increasing compile-time guarantees
  - Haskell's influence on type-driven development
  - TypeScript: Adding types to dynamic languages
- Build Tools and Static Analysis
  - Advanced dependency management
  - Automated testing in the build pipeline
  - Custom rules and validations

IV. Current State of the Art (4 minutes)
- Multi-stage Validation
  - Code generation phases
  - Protocol buffers and interface definition languages
  - Smart contract compilation pipelines
- Modern Static Analysis
  - Advanced type systems (dependent types, refinement types)
  - Automated theorem proving in build processes
  - Security scanning integration

V. The LLM Impact (3 minutes)
- Potential Changes to Traditional Pipelines
  - Generated code validation challenges
  - New types of static analysis for AI-generated code
  - Verifying AI-generated invariants
- Opportunities and Risks
  - Automated constraint generation
  - Dynamic pipeline adaptation
  - Maintaining human oversight

VI. Conclusion (1 minute)
- The trend toward earlier constraint definition
- Balancing flexibility and safety
- Future directions and open questions
