Thank you for confirming. I'll expand the presentation outline with more technical detail and specific examples:

Title: "From Makefiles to AI: The Evolution of Build-Time Constraints and Invariants"

I. Introduction (2 minutes)
- Evolution of software correctness philosophy
  - From "let it crash" to "fail fast" to "prevent invalid states"
  - Economic impact: Microsoft's estimate that bugs found in requirements cost 100x less to fix than production bugs
- Core challenge: Moving verification earlier in development cycle
  - Traditional testing vs. compile-time guarantees
  - The verification spectrum: from runtime to design-time

II. Historical Perspective (5 minutes)
- 1990s Build Systems
  - Make and its descendants (Ant, Maven)
    - File-based dependency tracking
    - Limited to timestamp-based invalidation
  - Early IDE integration
    - Microsoft Visual Studio's IntelliSense (1996)
    - Eclipse JDT's incremental compilation
- Static Analysis Evolution
  - From lint (1979) to modern tools
  - Case study: The birth of FindBugs and the rise of automated Java analysis
  - Evolution of gcc warnings and clang's static analyzer

III. Modern Build Pipeline Evolution (5 minutes)
- Type System Revolution
  - ML's influence on modern type systems
  - Rust's borrow checker: Compile-time memory safety
    - Example: How ownership prevents data races
  - TypeScript's structural typing
    - Real-world impact: How TS caught 15% of bugs at Microsoft before runtime
- Modern Build Tools
  - Bazel and Pants: Fine-grained dependency analysis
  - Buck and Please: Remote execution and caching
  - Example: How Google's monorepo enforces invariants across millions of lines of code

IV. Current State of the Art (4 minutes)
- Multi-stage Compilation
  - Protocol Buffers: Schema-first development
    - Impact on API design and versioning
  - Smart Contracts: Solidity's type system and formal verification
    - Case study: The DAO hack and subsequent tooling improvements
- Advanced Static Analysis
  - Facebook Infer: Separation logic at scale
  - Dependent types in Idris and Agda
    - Example: Proving array bounds at compile time
  - Integration with CI/CD
    - GitHub's CodeQL and Semantic Code Analysis

V. The LLM Impact (3 minutes)
- New Verification Challenges
  - Copilot's impact on code review processes
  - Verifying generated code against specifications
    - Example: Using OpenAI's code-davinci-002 with static analyzers
- Future Opportunities
  - LLM-assisted invariant generation
    - Using models to suggest type constraints
    - Automated documentation of implicit assumptions
  - Hybrid Systems
    - Combining traditional static analysis with LLM understanding
    - Example: Amazon's CodeWhisperer's security scanning

VI. Conclusion (1 minute)
- Key Trends
  - Movement toward "shift-left" verification
  - Integration of AI in traditional tooling
- Open Questions
  - Balance between automation and human oversight
  - Role of formal methods in an AI-assisted future
- Call to Action
  - Importance of investing in early verification
  - Need for new tools combining traditional and AI approaches

Supporting Materials:
- Code examples showing evolution of type systems
- Benchmark data on bug detection effectiveness
- Real-world case studies of verification failures
- Demonstration of LLM-assisted invariant checking

This expanded outline provides more concrete examples and specific technical details while maintaining a coherent narrative about the evolution of build-time verification. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular section or provide specific code examples for any of the concepts mentioned?
